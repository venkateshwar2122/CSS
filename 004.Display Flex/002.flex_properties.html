In this example, the .container div has display: flex, which makes it a flex container.
 The child div elements (items 1–4) are flex items, and flex-direction along with justify-content and 
align-items properties can control the arrangement and 
alignment of these items.

Let’s go over each property one by one:

1. flex-direction

The flex-direction property defines the direction in which the flex container arranges 
its items. 

Possible values are:
row (default):          Items are arranged in a row from left to right.
row-reverse:            Items are arranged in a row from right to left.
column:                 Items are arranged in a column from top to bottom.
column-reverse:         Items are arranged in a column from bottom to top.

Example 1: flex-direction: row; (default)

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}
Effect: Items (item1, item2, etc.) will be displayed in a row from left to right within
 the container.

Example 2: flex-direction: row-reverse;

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
}

Effect: Items will be displayed in a row from right to left within the container.

Example 3: flex-direction: column;


.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

Effect: Items will be displayed in a vertical column, with item1 at the top and item4 
at the bottom.

Example 4: flex-direction: column-reverse;

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
} 

Effect: Items will be displayed in a vertical column from bottom to top, with item4 
at the top and item1 at the bottom.


2. justify-content

The justify-content property aligns items along the main axis (defined by flex-direction).

flex-start:      Items are aligned to the start of the main axis.
flex-end:        Items are aligned to the end of the main axis.
center:          Items are centered along the main axis.
space-between:   Items are spread out with equal space between them.
space-around:   Items are spread out with space around them.

Example: justify-content: center;

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
}

Effect: Items will be centered horizontally within the container (if flex-direction: row) 
or vertically if using flex-direction: column.

3. align-items

The align-items property aligns items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).

flex-start:      Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.
flex-end:        Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
center:         Items are centered along the cross axis.
stretch (default): Items stretch to fill the container along the cross axis (only if no fixed height or width is set on the items).
baseline:         Items align along their baselines.

Example: align-items: center;

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
}

Effect: Items will be vertically centered within the container if flex-direction: row is
set, or horizontally centered if using flex-direction: column.

Putting It All Together
Here’s an example using all three properties:


.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
    
Explanation:

flex-direction: column; makes items stack vertically.
justify-content: center; centers items vertically within the container.
align-items: center; centers items horizontally within the container.
