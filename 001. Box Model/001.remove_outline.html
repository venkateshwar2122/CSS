To remove the outline (often seen around focusable elements like links, buttons, 
 form fields, etc.), you can use the outline property in CSS. However, removing 
 outlines can affect accessibility, as it removes visual cues for keyboard navigation.
  If you choose to remove or modify the outline, it's important to ensure that you 
  provide an alternative visual cue for users who navigate with the keyboard.

Here’s how to remove the outline in CSS:

1. Removing the Outline Completely
To remove the outline from an element (e.g., when it’s focused), use the following
 CSS:

element:focus {
  outline: none;
}
