<!--
In HTML, elements are broadly categorized as inline or block elements based on how they 
behave in relation to other elements on the page. Here’s a breakdown of the two:

1. Block Elements(takes full width , always start with new line)
->block element always start in the new line , it doesnot allow other elements to 
continue in the same line
Definition: Block elements take up the full width of their container by default and start
 on a new line.
Characteristics:
Always begin on a new line.
Take up the entire width of the container unless styled otherwise.
Can contain other block elements or inline elements.
Examples: <div>, <h1> to <h6>, <p>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>

2. Inline Elements
Definition: Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a 
new line.
Characteristics:
Do not start on a new line; they appear next to each other.
Only take up as much width as needed by their content.
Can contain only other inline elements, text, or images.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>

  <!--
  By default every HTML ELEMENT MAY BE INLINE OR BLOCK.
  TO change that default behaviour:-

  1) display: none;
  
  2} display:hidden;

   3) display: inline-block;
-
   4)display:inline;

  <!--in below example div is block element and span is inline element.
  in the code below we have not done any modiufication as of now

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        }
        .d1{
            background-color: red;
            
        }
        .d2{
            background-color: yellow;
        }
        .d3{
            background-color: green;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="d1">DIV-1</div>
    <div class ="d2">DIV-2</div>
    <div class="d3">DIV-3</div>


    <span class ="d1">SPAN1</span>
    <span class = "d2">SPAN2</span>
    <span class = "d3">SPAN3</span>
    
</body>
</html>


<!--

in this HTML example, we can explore the differences between display: none, display: block, 
display: inline-block, and display: inline by modifying the styles of <div> and 
<span> elements. Here’s how each display type would affect these elements:

1. display: none;

Effect: The element will not be displayed on the page at all; it is completely removed 
from the document's flow.
Use: To hide elements completely without affecting the layout of other elements.
Example:

.d1 {
    display: none;
}

Result: The red box (DIV-1) and red text (SPAN1) will not appear on the page.

2. display: block;

Effect: The element takes up the full width of its container and begins on a new line, 
pushing subsequent content down.
Use: For elements like <div> that need to act as containers or create distinct sections.
Example:

.d2 {
    display: block;
}

Result:

<div class="d2"> (yellow) takes up the full width of the container and 
    will push DIV-3 below it.
<span class="d2"> (yellow) will also take up the full width, 
    pushing SPAN3 below it and treating the span like a block element.

    3. display: inline-block;

Effect: The element takes up only as much width as necessary but maintains block-like 
properties, such as respecting width and height. Elements remain on the same line as 
other inline or inline-block elements.
Use: When you want block-like styling (with set width/height) while keeping elements 
on the same line.
Example:

.d3 {
    display: inline-block;
}

Result:

<div class="d3"> (green) will only take up 200px of width and 100px of height, but 
    DIV-2 will stay above it because DIV-3 is still treated as a block within the <div> flow.
<span class="d3"> (green) will appear on the same line as SPAN2, with its height and 
    width applied.

4. display: inline;

Effect: The element only takes as much width as its content requires. Width and 
height properties are ignored.
Use: For inline elements like <span> that need to appear inline with other text or elements.

 Example:

.d1 {
    display: inline;
}

Result:

<div class="d1"> (red) will appear inline with other elements, ignoring the specified 
    width and height.
<span class="d1"> (red) will appear inline as usual, with no changes in layout.
